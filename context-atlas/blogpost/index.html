  </span>
  <div class='side-note'>
    In linguistics, a word sense is one of the meanings of a word (definition from <a
       href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_sense'
       target='_blank'>wikipedia</a>.)
  </div>
  <p>
    Have you ever eaten a hot dog with hot sauce on a hot day? Even if you have not, you still
    understood the question—which is remarkable, since <b><i>hot</i></b> was used in three
    completely different
    senses. Humans effortlessly take context into account, disambiguating the multiple meanings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bringing this same skill to computers has been a longstanding open problem. A recently invented
    technique, the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf"
       target='_blank'>Transformer
      architecture</a>, is
    designed in a way that may begin to address this
    challenge. Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02715"
       target='_blank'>paper</a> explores one particular example of this type of architecture, a
    network
    called <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805'
       target='_blank'>BERT</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the key tools for representing meaning is a "<a
       href='https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec-652d0c2060fa'
       target='_blank'>word
      embedding</a>," that is, a map of words into points in high-dimensional Euclidean space. This
    kind of geometric representation can capture a surprisingly rich set of relationships between
    words, and word embeddings have become a critical component of many modern language-processing
    systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    The catch is that traditional word embeddings only capture a kind of "average" meaning of any
    given word--they have no way to take context into account. Transformer architectures are
    designed to take in a series of words--encoded via context-free word embeddings--and, layer by
    layer, transform them into "context embeddings." The hope is that these context embeddings will
    somehow represent useful information about the usage of those words in the particular sentence
    they appear. In other words, in the input to BERT, the word <b><i>hot</i></b> would be
    represented by the
    same point in space, no matter whether it appears next to <b><i>dog</i></b>,
    <b><i>sauce</i></b>, or <b><i>day</i></b>. But in
    subsequent layers, each <b><i>hot</i></b> would occupy a different point in space.

  </p>
  <p>
    In this blog, we describe visualizations that help us explore the geometry of these context
    embeddings--and which suggest that context embeddings do indeed capture different word senses.
    We then provide quantitative evidence for that hypothesis, showing that simple classifiers on
    context embedding data may be used to achieve state-of-the-art results on standard word sense
    disambiguation tasks. Finally, we show that there is strong evidence for a semantic
    subspace within the embedding space, similar to the syntactic subspace described by <a
       href='https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/hewitt2019structural.pdf'
       target='_blank'>Hewitt and
      Manning</a>, and discussed in the <a
       href='https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/bert-tree/'
       target='_blank'>first post</a> of this series.
  </p>

  <!-- Vis intro -->
  <h2>Part 1: <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/context-atlas/demo/index.html?#word=lie'
       target='_blank'>Context Atlas Visualization</a> </h2>
  <div class='side-note'>See a similar, independently created visualization by David McClure <a
       href='https://twitter.com/clured/status/1128723800391077888'
       target='_blank'>here</a>!</div>
  <p>
    So, which subtleties are captured in these embeddings, and which are lost? To understand this,
    we approach the question with a visualization which attempts to isolate the contextual
    information of a single word across many instances. How does BERT understand the meaning of a
    given word in each of these contexts?
  </p>
  <div class='side-note'>The BERT model comes in several sizes. Our visualization shows results for
    "BERT-base"</div>
  <p>
    When a word (e.g., <b><i>hot</i></b>)is entered, the system retrieves 1,000 sentences from
    wikipedia that contain <b><i>hot</i></b>. It sends these sentences to BERT as input, and
    for each one it retrieves the context embedding for <b><i>hot</i></b> at each layer.
  </p>
  <div class=side-note>
    UMAP is a technique for projecting high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional view.
  </div>
  <p>
    The system then visualizes these 1,000 context embeddings using <a
       href='https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'
       target='_blank'>UMAP</a>.
    The UMAP projection generally shows clear clusters relating to word senses, for example
    <b><i>hot</i></b> as in <b><i>hot day</i></b> or as in <b><i>hot dog</i></b>. Different senses
    of a word are typically spatially separated, and within the clusters there is often further
    structure related to fine shades of meaning.
  </p>
  <div class=side-note>
    We highlight words that appear in many sentences clustered in a small area, as measured by the
    median distance between sentences containing those words. We also show only as many labels as
    can fit without overlapping.
  </div>
  <p>To make it easier to interpret the visualization without mousing over every point, we added
    labels of words that are common between sentences in a cluster.</p>

  <!-- Walk -->
  <h3>Case study:
    <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/context-atlas/demo/index.html?#word=walk'
       target='_blank'><i><b>Walk</b></i></h3></a>
  <p>
    A natural question is whether the space is partitioned by part of speech. Showing the parts of
    speech can be enabled in the UI with the "show POS" toggle. The dots are then colored by the
    part of speech of the query word, and the labels are then uncolored.
  </p>
  <img src='imgs/walk.png'>
  <div class='caption'> Visualization of "walk" in various contexts.
  </div>
  <p>Indeed, this is the case. The words are partitioned into nouns and verbs.
  </p>
  <div class='row'
       style='border: none;'>
    <div><img class='sidegifs'
           src='imgs/walk_noun.gif'>
      <div class='caption'> One cluster with sentences using the word walk as a
        noun, as in "take a walk."
      </div>
    </div>
    <div><img class='sidegifs'
           src='imgs/walk_verb.gif'>
      <div class='caption'> The corresponding verb cluster, with sentences such as "they walk."
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Class -->
  <h3>Case study:
    <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/context-atlas/demo/index.html?#word=class'
       target='_blank'><i><b>Class</b></i></h3></a>
  <p>
    The separation of clusters goes beyond parts-of-speech. For the word <i><b>class</b></i>,
    below, the space is partitioned more subtly. To the top right, there is a cluster of
    sentences about working class, middle/upper/lower classes, etc. Below is the cluster for the
    educational sense of the word-- high school classes, students taking classes, etc. Still more
    clusters can be found for class-action lawsuits, equivalence classes in math, and more.
  </p>
  <img src='imgs/class.png'>


  <!-- Early layers -->
  <h3>Early Layers</h3>
  <p>
    The previous examples have all used embeddings from the last layer of BERT. But where do these
    clusters arise, and what do the embeddings look like as they progress through the network?
  </p>
  <p>
    For most words that only have one sense (e.g.,

    <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/context-atlas/demo/index.html?#word=happy'
       target='_blank'><i><b>happy</b></i></h3></a> or
    <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/context-atlas/demo/index.html?#word=man'
       target='_blank'><i><b>man</b></i></h3></a>), the earliest layer (token embeddings +
    positional embeddings, with one transformer layer) has a canonical spiral pattern. This pattern
    turns out to be based on the position of the word in the sentence, and reflects the way linear
    order is encoded into the BERT input. For example, the sentences with <i><b>happy</b></i> as the
    third word are clustered together, and are between the sentences with <i><b>happy</b></i> as the
    second word, and those with <i><b>happy</b></i> as the fourth word.
  </p>
  <div class='row'
       style='border: none;'>
    <div><img class='sidegifs'
           src='imgs/man layer 0.png'>

    </div>
    <div><img class='sidegifs'
           src='imgs/happy layer 0.png'>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class='side-note'>We have not really explored the reason for this; it could be due either
    to the vocabularies of different senses being dramatically different, or to the model learning
    that some words, when combined with <i><b>class</b></i>, change the meaning of the word
    <i><b>class</b></i> significantly (in contrast to happy, which has a similar meaning in any
    context.) However, these are both pure conjectures, and more research is necessary.
  </div>
  <p>
    Interestingly, many words (e.g.,
    <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/context-atlas/demo/index.html?#word=civil'
       target='_blank'><i><b>civil</b></i></h3></a>,
    <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/context-atlas/demo/index.html?#word=class'
       target='_blank'><i><b>class</b></i></h3></a>, and
    <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/context-atlas/demo/index.html?#word=state'
       target='_blank'><i><b>state</b></i></h3></a>), do not have this pattern at the first
    layer. Below are the embeddings for <i><b>class</b></i> at the first layer, which are already
    semantically clustered.
  </p>
  <img src='imgs/class 0.png'>

  <h3>Progression Through Layers</h3>
  <p>
    So what about the layers in between? Interestingly, there are often more disparate clusters in
    the middle of the model. The reason for this is somewhat of an open question. We know from <a
       href='https://iftenney.users.x20web.corp.google.com/www/papers/1905.05950.pdf'
       target='_blank'>Tenney et al</a> that BERT performs better on some semantic and syntactic
    tasks with embeddings from the middle of the model. Perhaps there is some information that is
    lost towards the later layers in service of some higher level task, that causes the more merged
    cluster.
    <p>
    </p>
    Another observation is that, towards the end of the network, most of the attention is
    paid to the CLS and SEP tokens (special tokens at the beginning and end of the sentence.) We’ve
    conjectured that this could make all clusters merge
    together to
    some degree.
  </p>

  <img src='imgs/happy_layers.gif'>
  <div class='caption'>Embedding clusters change significantly through the layers.</div>
  <p>
    The apparent detail in the clusters we visualized raises two immediate questions: first, can we
    quantitatively demonstrate that BERT embeddings capture word senses? Second, how can we resolve
    the fact that we observe BERT embeddings capturing semantics, when previously we saw those same
    embeddings capturing syntax?
  </p>
  <h2>Part 2: Quantitative Word Sense Analysis </h2>
  <p>
    The crisp clusters seen in the visualizations above suggest that BERT may create simple,
    effective internal representations of word senses, putting different meanings in different
    locations.
  </p>
  <p>
    To test this out quantitatively, we trained a simple nearest-neighbor classifier on
    these embeddings to perform word sense disambiguation (WSD).
  </p>
  <div class=side-note>
    We used the data and evaluation from <a
       href='http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/EACL_2017_Raganatoetal.pdf'
       target='_blank'>Raganato et al</a>: the training data was <a
       href='http://lcl.uniroma1.it/wsdeval/training-data'
       target='_blank'>SemCor</a> (33,362
    senses), and the testing data was the suite described by Raganato et al (3,669 senses).
  </div>
  <p>
    We follow the procedure described by <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365'
       target='_blank'>Peters et al</a>, who performed a similar experiment with the
    ELMo model. For a given word with n senses, we make a nearest-neighbor classifier where each
    neighbor is the centroid of a given word sense’s BERT-base embeddings in the training data. To
    classify a new word we find the closest of these centroids, defaulting to the most commonly used
    sense if the word was not present in the training data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The simple nearest-neighbor classifier achieves an F1 score of 71.1, higher than the current
    state of the art, with the accuracy monotonically increasing through the layers. This
    is a strong signal that context embeddings are representing word-sense information.
    Additionally, we got an higher score of 71.5 using the technique described in the
    following section.
  </p>

  <h2>Part 3: A Subspace for Semantics? </h2>
  <p>
    <a href='https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/hewitt2019structural.pdf'
       target='_blank'>Hewitt and
      Manning</a> found that there was an embedding subspace that appeared to contain syntactic
    information. We hypothesize that there
    might also exist a subspace for semantics. That is, a linear transformation under which words of
    the same sense would be closer together and words of different senses would be further apart.
  </p>
  <p>
    To explore this hypothesis, we trained a probe following Hewitt and Manning’s methodology.
  </p>
  <div class=side-note>
    Our training corpus was the same dataset described in part 2, filtered to include only words
    with at least two senses, each with at least two occurrences (for 8,542 out of the original
    33,362 senses).
  </div>
  <p>
    We initialized a random matrix $B\in{R}^{k\times m}$, testing different values for $m$. Loss is,
    roughly,
    defined as the difference between the average cosine similarity between embeddings of words with
    different senses, and that between embeddings of the same sense.
  </p>

      <div> 65.34</div>
      <div> 61.01</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    We evaluate our trained probes on the same dataset and WSD task used in part 2. As a control, we
    compare each trained probe against a random probe of the same shape. As mentioned, untransformed
    BERT embeddings achieve a state-of-the-art accuracy rate of 71.1%. We find that our trained
    probes are able to achieve slightly improved accuracy down to $m$ = 128 dimensions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though our probe achieves only a modest improvement in accuracy for final-layer embeddings, we
    note that we were able to more dramatically improve the performance of embeddings at earlier
    layers (see the Appendix in our paper for details: Figure 10). This suggests there is more
    semantic information in the geometry of earlier-layer embeddings than a first glance might
    reveal. Our results also support the idea that word sense information may be contained in a
    lower-dimensional space. This suggests a resolution to the question mentioned above: word
    embeddings encode both syntax and semantics, but perhaps in separate complementary subspaces.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Since embeddings produced by transformer models depend on context, it is natural to speculate
    that they capture the particular shade of meaning of a word as used in a particular sentence.
    (E.g., is <b><i>bark</i></b> an animal noise or part of a tree?) It is still somewhat mysterious
    how and where this happens, though. Through the explorations described above, we attempt to
    answer this question both qualitatively and quantitatively with evidence of geometric
    representations of word sense.
